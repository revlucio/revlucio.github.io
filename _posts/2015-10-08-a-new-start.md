I just deleted my old, cobwebbed blog and created a new one! Yay!

I've written many half posts the past year, and just left my old one moulding away. I then created a Ghost account and wrote some more posts that nobody saw because I never shared the links... and I've just gotten sick of not posting any of my thoughts somewhere.

Like many people who try to write I fear from putting something out there that isn't great quality - but obviously the only way to get great quality is to write a lot and get feedback. It's like writing software, you want to iterate over many attempts, get feedback, and improve. Hell, it's like anything in life.

And besides, it's not like anyone will actually read what I write! Mostly I can just use this as a place to gather my thoughts, and save things that I want to remember. Like every other developer blogger, that's the main purpose of this blog.
